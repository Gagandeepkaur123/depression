	               <h3 style="color:skyblue;">Four things that everyone should know about depression:</h3>
								 <h4>Depression is a real illness.</h4>
                 <h4>Depression affects people in different ways.</h4>
                 <h4>Depression is treatable.</h4>
                 <h4>If you have depression, you are not alone.</h4>
                 <h3 style="color:skyblue;">Signs and Symptoms</h3>
								 <h4>Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood.</h4>
								 <h4>Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism.</h4>
								 <h4>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness.</h4>
								 <h4>Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities.</h4>
								 <h4>Decreased energy, fatigue, being “slowed down”.</h4>
								 <h4>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions.</h4>
								 <h4>Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping.</h4>
								 <h4>Appetite and/or weight changes.</h4>
								 <h4>Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts.</h4>
								 <h4>Restlessness, irritability.</h4>
								 <h4>Persistent physical symptoms.</h4>
                 <h3 style="color:skyblue;">How Is Depression Treated?</h3>
								 <h4>Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.</h4>
								 <h4><b>Medication:</b> Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.</h4>
								 <h4><b>Psychotherapy:</b> Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.</h4>
								 <h4><b>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</b> is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. </h4>
                 <h3 style="color:skyblue;">Types of Depression</h3>
								 <h4><b>Major Depressive Disorder</b> This illness impairs a person's ability to work, sleep, eat, and function as he or she normally would. It keeps people from enjoying activities that were once pleasurable, and causes them to think about themselves and the world in negative ways. Major depression is often disabling and may occur several times in a person's lifetime.</h4>
                 <h4><b>Dysthymic Disorder</b> A milder yet more enduring type of major depression. People with dysthymia may appear to be chronically mildly depressed to the point that it seems to be a part of their personality. When a person finally seeks treatment for dysthymia, it is not uncommon that he/she has struggled with this condition for a number of years.</h4>
								 <h4><b>Bipolar Disorder</b> Also known as manic-depression or manic-depressive disorder. This condition is characterized by mood that alternates between periods of depression and periods of elation and excitable behavior known as mania (see symptoms below). For people who have bipolar disorder, the depressions can be severe and the mania can seriously impair one's normal judgment. </h4>
								 <h4><b>Cyclothymic Disorder</b> A milder yet more enduring type of bipolar disorder. A person's mood alternates between a less severe mania (known as hypomania) and a less severe depression.</h4>
								 <h4><b>Mood Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition</b> Depression may be caused or precipitated by a known or unknown physical medical condition such as hypothyroidism.</h4>
								 <h4><b>Substance-Induced Mood Disorder</b> Depression may be caused or precipitated by the use or abuse of substances such as drugs, alcohol, medications, or toxins.</h4>
								 <h4><b>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</b> This condition affects people during specific times or seasons of the year. During the winter months individuals feel depressed and lethargic, but during other months their moods may be normal. </h4>
